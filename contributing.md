# Contributing to OMAF

Thank you for your interest in improving the **Ontological Model Assessment Framework (OMAF)**!

## Ways to Contribute

- **Refine criteria** — Suggest improved wording or coverage for completeness, robustness, pragmatic usefulness, or transformative potential.
- **Improve scoring anchors** — Make rubric definitions clearer, more objective, or more universally applicable.
- **Case studies** — Apply OMAF to existing ontologies and share results.
- **Visualisation tools** — Build charts, dashboards, or interactive scoring apps.
- **Translations** — Make OMAF available in other languages.

## Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes.
2. **Edit relevant files** (rubric, templates, docs).
3. **Submit a pull request (PR)** with a clear explanation of your changes and why they improve OMAF.
4. The maintainer (John Mackay) will review PRs to ensure they preserve the **core design philosophy** of OMAF.

## Design Philosophy

- **Domain-neutrality** — Must remain applicable to any ontology in any field.
- **Hybrid assessment** — Keep both qualitative notes and quantitative scores.
- **Transparency** — All changes and scoring logic should be open and documented.
- **Respect for influences** — Credit original thinkers whose ideas informed OMAF.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative. OMAF is an intellectual tool meant to advance clear thinking and fair evaluation.
