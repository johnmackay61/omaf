## 📖 Overview

The **Ontological Model Assessment Framework (OMAF)** is a universal, domain-neutral method for evaluating any ontology (*account of being*) across four key dimensions:

1. **Completeness** — Does the ontology fully account for the domain? (*What, How, Why, Boundaries*)
2. **Robustness** — Is it internally sound, generalizable, and resilient to critique?
3. **Pragmatic Usefulness** — Can it guide real-world inquiry or application?
4. **Transformative Potential** — Can it reshape understanding or relation to the domain?

OMAF is designed to work for any domain, from **abstract metaphysics** (e.g., existence itself) to **applied ontologies** (e.g., love, knowledge, technology).

## 🆕 Key Features

- **What–How–Why** structure mapped to Toulmin’s **Claim–Data–Warrant**
- **Hybrid rubric** — numerical scores (1–5) + qualitative notes
- **Radar chart visualisation** — quick view of strengths/weaknesses
- **Domain-neutral** — works for philosophical, scientific, and applied ontologies
- **Open-source** — refine, build on, fork, or adapt

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the Excel template** from the repository.
2. **Enter scores (1–5)** for each criterion, adding brief justification notes.
3. **View the radar chart** on the "Axis Summary" sheet to see your results at a glance.
4. **Refine scores** based on discussion, peer review, or additional evidence.

## 📊 Scoring Scale

- **1 – Very Weak**: Absent or fails
- **2 – Weak**: Present but poorly justified
- **3 – Moderate**: Adequate, some weaknesses
- **4 – Strong**: Well-developed, few issues
- **5 – Exceptional**: Exemplary, robust, resilient
