### Axis I — Completeness

#### 1. Grounding
Does the ontology clearly state its foundational principle(s)?

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No clear foundation; vague or assumed.|
|2|Foundation stated but poorly defined or inconsistent.|
|3|Clear basis with some unresolved assumptions.|
|4|Well-defined, coherent grounding; explicitly justified.|
|5|Foundational principle is clear, justified, and integrated into all aspects.|
#### 2. Manifestation
How well does it explain _how_ being appears/operates?

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No account of manifestation.|
|2|Minimal description; lacks operational clarity.|
|3|Adequate description; works for central cases.|
|4|Clear, detailed account covering core and edge cases.|
|5|Comprehensive, precise, and operationally testable.|
#### 3. Persistence
Why does the domain endure or recur?

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No explanation for persistence.|
|2|Ad hoc or context-specific persistence.|
|3|General mechanism proposed; partly justified.|
|4|Well-supported mechanism; explains stability/change.|
|5|Robust, widely applicable persistence mechanism, integrated with grounding & manifestation.|
#### 4. Boundaries
Are the limits of the domain defined and respected?

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No boundaries; applies everywhere by fiat.|
|2|Boundaries implied but vague or shifting.|
|3|Clear boundaries with some ambiguities.|
|4|Well-defined, justified boundaries; mostly respected.|

|5|Universally applicable within domain.|
#### 3. Objectivity / Reflexivity

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No awareness of own assumptions.|
|2|Limited awareness; ignores implications.|
|3|Acknowledges some assumptions; partially self-applicable.|

|5|Fully self-aware and reflexive; withstands multiple perspectives.|
#### 4. Explanatory Power

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Explains little or nothing.|
|2|Explains some aspects; lacks depth.|
|3|Adequate explanatory coverage.|
|4|Explains well, with rich insight.|
|5|Explains comprehensively; unifies diverse phenomena.|
#### 5. Resilience to Critique

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Collapses under basic critique.|
|2|Responds weakly to most critiques.|
|3|Handles some critiques effectively.|
|4|Responds to most critiques; adapts constructively.|
|5|Anticipates, integrates, and strengthens from critique.|
### Axis III — Pragmatic Usefulness

#### 1. Operational Clarity

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No guidance for action/inquiry.|
|2|Minimal guidance; vague steps.|
|3|Some guidance; works for simple tasks.|
|4|Clear guidance; works for complex tasks.|
|5|Highly actionable; readily implementable.|
#### 2. Integrability

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Incompatible with other models/disciplines.|
|2|Limited integration possible.|
|3|Some integration; needs adaptation.|
|4|Integrates smoothly with others.|
|5|Highly interoperable; enhances other models.|
#### 3. Heuristic Utility

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No new tools/concepts provided.|
|2|Few tools; limited usefulness.|
|3|Some useful concepts/tools.|
|4|Rich set of tools; widely applicable.|
|5|Exceptional heuristic value; generates new lines of inquiry.|
### Axis IV — Transformative Potential

#### 1. Cognitive Shift

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No change in perspective.|
|2|Slight change; low impact.|
|3|Moderate perspective shift.|
|4|Significant change in thinking.|
|5|Profound, lasting shift in worldview.|
#### 2. Experiential Depth

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|No change in lived experience.|
|2|Minimal impact on experience.|
|3|Some deepening of engagement.|
|4|Strong deepening of experience.|
|5|Radically deepens and enriches experience.|
#### 3. Generativity

|Score|Description|
|---|---|
|1|Generates no new interpretations.|
|2|Rarely sparks new ideas.|
|3|Occasionally generates new interpretations/models.|
|4|Frequently sparks new interpretations/models.|

>[!Note] Acknowledgements
>The OMAF rubric draws conceptual inspiration from Toulmin’s model of argumentation, philosophical theory-appraisal frameworks (Lakatos, Thagard, Kuhn), and ontology evaluation methods in knowledge engineering (Gruber’s criteria, OntoClean, competency questions, OBO/FAIR principles). While OMAF is an original synthesis intended for universal application to accounts of being across any domain, it builds upon these prior contributions in both spirit and scope.
