# Literature Review — Ontological Model Assessment Framework (OMAF)

## 1. Purpose

This review surveys existing frameworks for evaluating ontologies in both **philosophy/meta-ontology** and **computer/information science**.  
Its goal is to:
- Map adjacent frameworks to OMAF’s **what–how–why** structure and four axes.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in the current state of the field.
- Highlight the unique gap OMAF fills.

---

## 2. Executive Summary

**Closest neighbors** come from two traditions:
1. **Philosophy / meta-ontology & theory appraisal** — grounding, coherence, explanatory power.
2. **Information/CS ontology evaluation** — clarity, formal coherence, operational testing.

**Gap OMAF fills:**  
A **domain-neutral, philosophy-first framework** that applies to *any* ontology, explicitly incorporating:
- **What** (Grounding)
- **How** (Manifestation)
- **Why** (Persistence)
- Boundaries
- Robustness
- Pragmatic Usefulness
- Transformative Potential

## 4. Strengths & Weaknesses by Family

### A) Philosophical / Meta-Ontological
- **Strengths:** Deep grounding, scope discipline, coherence checks.
- **Weaknesses:** Limited operational criteria, underdeveloped persistence analysis, rarely quantified.

### B) CS / Information Ontology Evaluation
- **Strengths:** Concrete validation tools, logical consistency checks, governance standards.
- **Weaknesses:** Weak metaphysical grounding, minimal treatment of persistence or transformative impact.

### C) Conceptual Modelling / Foundational Ontologies
- **Strengths:** Rich categorical analyses, integrability patterns.
- **Weaknesses:** Prescriptive rather than evaluative; limited transformative scope.

## 5. Mapping to OMAF Axes

- **Completeness:**  
  - *What:* Meta-ontology & grounding literature (Fine, Schaffer, Sider, Thomasson, Lowe).  
  - *How:* Foundational ontologies & CS modelling methods (DOLCE, BFO, Gruber, OntoClean).  
  - *Why:* Underrepresented; occasional treatment in powers metaphysics or process philosophy.  
  - *Boundaries:* Addressed in both philosophical and CS contexts, but rarely integrated.

- **Robustness:** Logical coherence, domain validity, reflexivity, explanatory power, resilience.

- **Pragmatic Usefulness:** Competency questions, governance frameworks, fruitfulness.

- **Transformative Potential:** Kuhn/Lakatos/Thagard — conceptual shifts, paradigm change.

## 7. Implications for OMAF

- Keep **what–how–why** explicit — they are unevenly treated in the literature.
- Integrate **boundary discipline** across both completeness and robustness.
- Treat **transformative potential** as a first-class evaluative axis.
- Translate **competency questions** into philosophical contexts.
