## 1. Purpose

The Ontological Model Assessment Framework (OMAF) is a universal, domain-neutral system for evaluating any ontology — an *account of being* — across four key axes:

1. **Completeness** — What grounds it? How does it manifest? Why does it persist? Where are its boundaries?
2. **Robustness** — Is it logically sound, generalizable, and resilient to critique?
3. **Pragmatic Usefulness** — Can it guide real-world inquiry or application?
4. **Transformative Potential** — Can it reshape understanding or relation to the domain?

OMAF is designed for use in both **academic** and **non-academic** contexts. It is suitable for philosophical, scientific, and applied ontologies alike.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Domain-neutrality** — Applicable to any ontology, from metaphysics to love, knowledge, or technology.
- **Hybrid scoring** — Combines quantitative ratings (1–5) with qualitative notes for depth and nuance.
- **What–How–Why structure** — Explicitly maps onto Toulmin’s Claim–Data–Warrant model to ensure decision adequacy, not just descriptive adequacy.
- **Transparency** — All criteria and scoring justifications should be open to review.

## 3. The Four Axes and Criteria

### Axis I — Completeness
- **Grounding** — The foundational principle or process.
- **Manifestation** — How being appears or operates.
- **Persistence** — Why the domain endures or recurs.
- **Boundaries** — Scope and limits of the domain.

### Axis II — Robustness
- **Internal Coherence** — Consistency and non-contradiction.
- **Domain Validity** — Applicability across the domain.
- **Objectivity / Reflexivity** — Awareness of assumptions and self-application.
- **Explanatory Power** — Breadth and depth of explanation.
- **Resilience to Critique** — Ability to withstand and integrate challenges.

### Axis III — Pragmatic Usefulness
- **Operational Clarity** — Guidance for action or inquiry.
- **Integrability** — Compatibility with other models or disciplines.
- **Heuristic Utility** — Generativity of concepts, tools, or frameworks.

### Axis IV — Transformative Potential
- **Cognitive Shift** — Change in how the domain is thought about.
- **Experiential Depth** — Enrichment of lived engagement.
- **Generativity** — Capacity to generate new interpretations or models.

## 4. Scoring

### Scale
- **1 – Very Weak** — Absent or fails entirely.
- **2 – Weak** — Present but poorly justified or incomplete.
- **3 – Moderate** — Adequate but with notable gaps.
- **4 – Strong** — Well-developed and supported, minor weaknesses.
- **5 – Exceptional** — Exemplary, thorough, and resilient.

### Approach
- **Numerical** scores for quick comparison.
- **Qualitative notes** to preserve reasoning and context.
- **Radar chart** to visualise axis-level strengths and weaknesses.
- No composite “overall score” unless context-specific weighting is applied.

---

## 5. Evidence Sources
- Textual analysis of ontology statements.
- Comparative review against other ontologies.
- Empirical data (where applicable).
- Logical and conceptual testing (e.g., edge cases, counterexamples).

---

## 6. Use Cases
- Academic research evaluation.
- Independent philosophical inquiry.
- Cross-disciplinary model comparison.
- Teaching and curriculum development.
- Self-assessment of ontological models.

---

## 7. Limitations
- OMAF evaluates the **form and scope** of an ontology, not its truth value.
- Scores reflect **fit for purpose** within the chosen domain, not universal correctness.
