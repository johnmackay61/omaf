# Mapping What–How–Why to Toulmin and OMAF

### 1. Overview

The What–How–Why structure in OMAF is inspired by Stephen Toulmin’s **Claim–Data–Warrant** model of argumentation.  
This mapping ensures that ontologies are evaluated not only for **descriptive adequacy** (*what* and *how*) but also for **decision adequacy** (*why*).

The combined formula for application is:

> **What → How → Why**  
> **Claim → Data → Warrant**  
> **Proposition → Evidence → Authority**

| Dimension | Ontology Focus                                         | Toulmin Element                                                 | OMAF Placement                                                                                                                            | Worked Example (Conference of Difference)                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What**  | Grounding — what *is* the being of this domain?        | **Claim** — the ontological proposition                         | **Completeness → Grounding**, **Robustness → Internal Coherence**                                                                         | The CoD is the universal process by which all existence emerges through interaction of difference.                                              |
| **How**   | Manifestation & dynamics — how does it appear/operate? | **Data** — evidence, patterns, operational description          | **Completeness → Manifestation**, **Robustness → Domain Validity**, **Pragmatic Usefulness → Operational Clarity**                        | In physics, particle interactions; in biology, genetic variation; in economics, market exchanges — each reflects a CoD generating new outcomes. |
| **Why**   | Persistence — why does it endure or recur?             | **Warrant** (+Backing) — authority linking claim to application | **Completeness → Persistence**, **Robustness → Explanatory Power**, **Pragmatic Usefulness → Use-Case Fit**, **Transformative Potential** | Across domains, systems that fail in the CoD stagnate and collapse, whereas success in the CoD sustains adaptation and survival.                |
| **Scope** | Boundaries — what’s in/out of the domain               | **Qualifier** (modal strength) + **Rebuttal** (exceptions)      | **Completeness → Boundaries**, **Robustness → Resilience to Critique**, **Domain Validity**                                               | Applies wherever difference exists and can interact; does not apply to isolated, closed systems with no exchange.                               |
### 3. Why *Why* Matters

The **why** dimension (warrant) bridges **description** and **application**:

- **Decision adequacy** — clarifies when, where, and why the ontology applies best.  
- **Predictive discipline** — specifies conditions of success and failure.  
- **Comparability** — enables fair trade-off analysis between competing ontologies.  

Without *why*, ontologies risk being **catalogued** rather than **chosen** for context.
### 4. Rubric Hooks for Warrant Assessment

When scoring **Persistence / Warrant Strength**:

- **Strength of Warrant** — ad hoc → principled, generalizable, and supported.  
- **Scope Fit (Qualifier)** — overbroad →
