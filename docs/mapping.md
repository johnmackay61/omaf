## 1. Overview

The What–How–Why structure in OMAF is inspired by Stephen Toulmin’s **Claim–Data–Warrant** model of argumentation.  
This mapping ensures that ontologies are evaluated not only for descriptive adequacy (*what* and *how*) but also for **decision adequacy** (*why*).

## 2. Mapping Table

| Dimension | Ontology Focus | Toulmin Element | OMAF Placement |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **What** | Grounding — what *is* the being of this domain? | **Claim** — the ontological thesis | **Completeness → Grounding**, **Robustness → Internal Coherence** |
| **How** | Manifestation & dynamics — how does it appear/operate? | **Data** — evidences, patterns, operational description | **Completeness → Manifestation**, **Robustness → Domain Validity**, **Pragmatic Usefulness → Operational Clarity** |
| **Why** | Persistence — why does it endure or recur? | **Warrant** (+Backing) — justification linking claim to application | **Completeness → Persistence**, **Robustness → Explanatory Power**, **Pragmatic Usefulness → Use-Case Fit**, **Transformative Potential** |
| **Scope** | Boundaries — what’s in/out of the domain | **Qualifier** (modal strength) + **Rebuttal** (exceptions) | **Completeness → Boundaries**, **Robustness → Resilience to Critique**, **Domain Validity** |

## 3. Why *Why* Matters

The **why** dimension (warrant) bridges **description** and **application**:
- **Decision adequacy** — clarifies when and where the ontology applies best.
- **Predictive discipline** — specifies conditions of success and failure.
- **Comparability** — enables fair trade-off analysis between competing ontologies.

Without *why*, ontologies risk being **catalogued** rather than **chosen** for context.

## 4. Rubric Hooks for Warrant Assessment

When scoring **Persistence / Warrant Strength**:
- **Strength of Warrant** — ad hoc → principled, generalizable, backed.
- **Scope Fit (Qualifier)** — overbroad → appropriately bounded.
- **Rebuttal Handling** — brittle → resilient with principled exceptions.

## 5. Implications for OMAF

By explicitly including *why*, OMAF:
- Promotes ontologies that are **fit for context**.
- Encourages balance between **completeness**, **robustness**, and **pragmatics**.
- Captures **transformative potential** as an assessable feature, not just an incidental outcome.
