# Acknowledgements — Ontological Model Assessment Framework (OMAF)

OMAF was developed by **John Mackay** to provide a universal, domain-neutral framework for evaluating any ontology (“account of being”) across four dimensions: **completeness**, **robustness**, **pragmatic usefulness**, and **transformative potential**.

While OMAF is an original synthesis, it draws conceptual inspiration from the following traditions and thinkers:

---

## Argumentation Theory
- **Stephen Toulmin** — *The Uses of Argument* (1958).  
  OMAF’s “what–how–why” axis maps closely to Toulmin’s **Claim–Data–Warrant** structure, with “why” serving as the warrant that connects descriptive adequacy to decision adequacy.

---

## Philosophy of Science & Theory Appraisal
- **Imre Lakatos** — Progressive vs. degenerative research programmes.
- **Paul Thagard** — Criteria for evaluating theories: simplicity, scope, fruitfulness, consilience.
- **Thomas Kuhn** — Paradigm shifts, disciplinary matrices, and conceptual transformation.
These works influenced OMAF’s *transformative potential* axis and its emphasis on resilience to critique.

---

## Meta-Ontology & Grounding
- **Kit Fine** — Work on grounding and metaphysical structure.
- **Jonathan Schaffer** — Priority monism and grounding relations.
- **Amie Thomasson** — Conceptual engineering and “easy ontology” methodology.
- **E.J. Lowe** — The four-category ontology.
These thinkers informed OMAF’s *grounding*, *manifestation*, and *persistence* criteria.

## Ontology Engineering & Evaluation
- **Thomas R. Gruber** — Ontology design evaluation criteria (clarity, coherence, extendibility, minimal encoding bias, minimal ontological commitment).
- **Nicola Guarino & Chris Welty** — OntoClean methodology for formal ontology evaluation.
- **Competency Questions** — From methodologies such as the Toronto Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) ontology project.
- **OBO Foundry Principles** — Shared governance and quality guidelines for bio-ontologies.
- **FAIR Principles** — Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability for data.

These influenced OMAF’s *robustness*, *boundaries*, *integrability*, and *operational clarity* criteria.
